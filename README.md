## üé® Design Decisions

### Why React with TypeScript?
- **Type Safety**: Ensures robust code with compile-time error checking
- **Component Modularity**: Easy to maintain and extend
- **Developer Experience**: Excellent tooling and debugging capabilities

### Why Tailwind CSS?
- **Rapid Development**: Utility-first approach speeds up styling
- **Consistent Design**: Built-in design system with spacing and colors
- **Responsive Design**: Easy to implement responsive layouts
- **Custom Animations**: Simple to add micro-interactions

### Why Lucide React?
- **Lightweight**: Tree-shakeable icon library
- **Consistent Style**: Cohesive icon design
- **Customizable**: Easy to style and animate

## üöÄ Performance Optimizations

- **Code Splitting**: Components are lazily loaded where beneficial
- **Optimized Images**: No unnecessary image assets
- **Efficient Re-renders**: Strategic use of React hooks to minimize updates
- **CSS Optimization**: Tailwind purges unused styles in production
- **Bundle Size**: Minimal dependencies for fast loading

## üîß Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge: Smooth Multi-step Flow
**Solution**: Implemented state-based navigation with smooth transitions between steps, maintaining form data throughout the flow.

### Challenge: Custom Slider Styling
**Solution**: Created cross-browser compatible slider styles using CSS custom properties and vendor prefixes.

### Challenge: API Error Handling
**Solution**: Implemented comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages and retry options.

### Challenge: Responsive Design
**Solution**: Used Tailwind's responsive utilities with a mobile-first approach, ensuring optimal experience across all devices.

## üîÆ Future Improvements

With more time, I would implement:

1. **Data Persistence**: Local storage to save drafts and history
2. **Analytics Dashboard**: Visualize mood patterns over time
3. **Accessibility Enhancements**: Screen reader support and keyboard navigation
4. **PWA Features**: Offline functionality and push notifications
5. **Animation Library**: More sophisticated animations with Framer Motion
6. **Testing Suite**: Comprehensive unit and integration tests
7. **Theme Customization**: Dark mode and personalized color schemes
